# Extensions
The letqanque extension is a copy of the CustomizeUI extension by iocave. It was making some odd network requests, crashing, and asking me for coffee all the time. SO I ripped it off, made my own version, and it works. Mostly.

Still crashes, still has occassional problems. Needs work.
